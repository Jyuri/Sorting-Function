I need to learn more about how to use PySimpleGUI.
The endgame would be making a "graph" with a number of bars (or slots)
    that can be changed to reflect data being shifted.

Currently, my plan is to add and delete bars as data is shifted.
This would also include a change of color for each shift, to reflect what is happening.

If possible, I would rather just shift them around and simply change the color,
    but I don't think it will be that simple.

Once the basic framework is included, implimentation can commence.
